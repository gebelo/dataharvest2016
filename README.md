<h1>Dataharvest 2016 Materials</h1>

<p>This is the powerpoint from my talk "Marrying Data and Investigative Journalism."</p>
<p>These files are for my class on advanced parsing with SQL. I have two versions of the exercise, one for Microsoft SQL Server users, and one for MySQL users. In addition, I have several versions of the data file in various formats to accommodate users with various software.P
	<ul>
		<li>There's a CSV that can be imported.</li>
		<li>A MySQL dump file that you can load and run</li>
		<li>Some SQL Server users might find it easier to import a spreadsheet</li>
	</ul>
	
<p>Once you have the data imported, load the appropriate version of the exercise -- Microsoft SQL Server version, or the MySQL version.</p>
