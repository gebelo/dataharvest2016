#Welcome to R I!

#This is the first of a series of three introductory classes on R.
#In the first class, R I, we'll discuss the origins and basic functions of R.

#In this class we'll look at:
#1. What is R?
#2. What can R be aused for?
#3. A tour around R & RStudio
#4. Importing data 
#5. Examining data

##################
##1. What is R? ##
##################

#R is a programming language and open-source statistical programming tool 
#It can be used for data analysis, visualising data and developing software
#We're going to use RStudio where you can see your data and commands in 4 panels
#The four panels are the console, where you execute commands; 
#A history panel; a workspace for display and a file/plot space

###############################
##2. What can R be used for? ##
###############################

#There are many reasons why R has become more popular in recent years
#Some of the reasons are that it can be used for analysis and visuals
#It’s powerful, free, has a large community of users and packages

#################################
##3. A tour around R & RStudio ##
#################################

#R is the program and language
#RStudio is the user interface or GUI that we’ll be using

#RStudio is useful as you can see your data and commands in 4 panels
#The four panels are: 

#1.The console is in the bottom left corner
#This is where you execute commands
#Execute is just a fancy word for run
#Let’s try to run a command
#You can use the console like a calculator

5+5

5*10
 
#Now you can try typing in a command…

#2.The source editor
#This is directly above the console, in the top left corner
#Here you can write and edit scripts
#You can also run scripts from this area
#It also acts as a dataviewer
#When you open a dataset, it will appear here
#That way you can view and inspect datasets that are loaded into the R environment

#3.The workspace 
#In the top right corner is the workspace 
#Here you can view objects in their global environment
#This means viewing what else is loaded onto the directory the scripts are being run from
#You can also use the top right corner pane to search your command history
#This allows you to see the scripts and commands you have used in context
#It can be useful when you want to reuse parts of a script

#What does the history pane show you?

#4.File and plot space 
#This is in the lower right pane 
#Here you can view the packages you have installed, plots that you make and R help
#What can you see is loaded into the Studio environment under the “File” tab?

#You can get different views by toggling between different screens
#Let’s look at the help command for View
#Type this into the console

??View

##4. Importing data ##
######################

#In order to work in R, we’re going to want to load some data

#There is some data already in our project, see the file panel
#What is it called?

#The data named DE_EDHIW and DE_PILW is from a group called the Luxembourg Income Study
#Earlier this year the Guardian published a series on intergenerational inequality
#This is the equivalised disposable income data for German household by the age of the head of the household

#Let's read one of the csv files into R
#To read in the data we’ll type…
read.csv("DE_EDHIW.csv") 

#What can you see?

#Now in this case we want to give the dataset a name
#Or assign the csv a name

disposableincome <- read.csv("DE_EDHIW.csv")

#In R the default when a csv is being read in by R is to treat the first row as a header row

#Let’s open our data and take a look
#The command to see the data in a tabulated format is View
View(disposableincome)

######################
##5. Examining data ##
######################

#What does the data look like?
#What kinds of things might you want to find from this data?
#What are the top lines you would want to find from the data? 

#We’re going to analyse the data for some story lines in the next session!
